Staking refers to the process of delegating a fixed amount of cryptocurrencies for a specified time frame in exchange for earning rewards. Staking has established itself as a viable way for people to earn passive rewards, especially in times in which the fiat banking system does not offer any yields at all.

AXIA has introduced staking programs where the rewards and benefits provided to participants go well beyond what is available in the market today. Typically staking rewards are offered and compared in terms of an Annual Percentage Yield (APY). 

AXIA has commenced its staking program by offering much higher rewards in terms of APY than industry standard, but most notably AXIA staking rewards will be compounded daily, hence supercharging the stakeholdersâ€™ total yield.

The longer a participant stakes their AXIA Coin, the longer it will not be a part of the circulating supply. This is not only more advantageous for the AXIA Network due to the improved fundamentals, but the participants themselves gain more due to the higher yield they receive. The improved fundamentals go beyond just the fact that additional AXIA Coin are burned through staking. There is also the immediate boost from greater scarcity through the reduction of Total Supply as an equivalent amount of AXIA Coin are immediately burned once they are placed into a staking program. Furthermore, an equivalent amount of the rewards that are generated daily are also burned; and finally, at the end of the term an equivalent amount of AXIA Coin is also burned. All of this together simultaneously provides the benefits of a lower circulating supply for both the AXIA Network and all the participants. This augments the value of the overall reward that the participant receives from staking in a unique and highly favorable way. 

AXIA will initially offer several different coin staking terms for the AXIA Coin, all of them generating high annual rewards and magnified by the power of daily compounding, as illustrated in the table below:

The staking rewards are provided for AXIA Capital Bank members, while successful Validators on the network can generate 33% more on top of the APY as listed below.

## AXIA Tokenomics
AXIA is introducing a proprietary monetary model that combines a number of economic features that provide unique benefits to participants and holders of the AXIA Coin. 

AXIA is the first ever hyper-deflationary asset supported digital currency that provides real-time transparency of its treasury holdings. The AXIA Treasury has been established to give additional support to AXIA Coin and its holders. 

The unique combination of a coin supply that reduces through coin burning from activities such as participating and staking, along with the treasury that can grow with total visibility to the market enables the enhancement of the purchasing power of the AXIA Coin. The  proprietary tokenomic design is enabled by a variety of smart contracts built into the AXIA project.

Wherever possible, third-parties have been utilized to review, report and audit on the viability of the economics, the reporting tools utilized and smart contracts put in place to ensure security, reliability and credibility is always in place.
## AXIA Coin Burning
The coin burning mechanism is facilitated from a variety of inputs that will only increase in velocity as the AXIA Ecosystem continues to expand. This hyper-deflationary aspect of the economic design

The AXIA Coin Burning Smart Contract ensures that coins are burned from the Total Supply when any of the following four events happens:
1. A purchase of AXIA Coin inside the AXIA Ecosystem
2. When an AXIA Coin is placed in a staking pool
3. At the end of the staking term when an AXIA Coin is released from the pool
4. When an activity in the ecosystem generates an eligible fee.  For example:  
    * Upon use of an AXIA debit card, the associated transaction fee is generated and the equivalent amount of that fee is burned.  
    * If a user generates fees through the use of an ecosystem app or platform such as AXplorer or AXclusive, then the equivalent amount is burned.
5. As earnings are generated from the AXIA Ecosystem applications, platforms and businesses as well as from associated partnerships, a corresponding amount of AXIA coins will be burned based on the USD value being placed into the AXIA Treasury.  

With this structure, AXIA Coins will constantly be burned with virtually every interaction or activity within the ecosystem as the AXIA Treasury can be increasing simultaneously, consistently enhancing value for AXIA Coin holders over time. All this is occurring through the decentralized activity of the AXIA participants. Going forward, additional coin burning trigger events may be added if deemed appropriate. 

With this design there is assurance that AXIA Coin will increase the rate of coin burning over time ensuring that the coin becomes more and more scarce, providing consistent value to AXIA community members. This constant reduction in supply not only can strengthen purchasing power, but exemplifies how the economic model of the AXIA Coin is anti-dilutive. This is the complete contrast to the alternative currencies that institute a monetary policy in which there is the capacity to mint more currency whether by a centralized organization or based on specified parameters in decentralized systems. This means the total supply of these instruments are essentially infinite; whether they be fiat currency or cryptocurrency.

Monetary theorists have proposed that minting / printing more currency increases productivity for an economy. As explained this has been proven false specifically by the debt based sovereign currency models that are in place today. Additionally, this has not removed the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. Though there have been many advancements in technology over the last decades, productivity has not grown in proportion. 

Inflationary monetary policies where currency can be minted at any time in whatever amount, have proven that not only will there be a loss of purchasing power, hence value, but there is minimal or no significant increase in productivity. It establishes a system of wealth concentration and unfairness. In the case of sovereign currencies a dependence on debt. 

The architecture of the AXIA tokenomics is specifically based on having a model that increases productivity and prosperity for all in an equitable manner. Where there will be opportunity for all individuals to advance themselves and improve the life of others as well as increase efficiency and productivity for businesses.

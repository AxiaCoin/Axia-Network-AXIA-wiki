AXIA created a suite of free, ready-to-use applications all incorporating an embedded wallet for the AXIA Coin enabling monetization, commercialization and reward possibilities in our day to day use making them superior to existing competition. 
### AXplorer
AXplorer is a free private and secure online web browser where individuals can confidently surf the Internet without being tracked. AXplorer also makes it easy for users to earn rewards while visiting all of their favourite websites by opting into a benefits program where they are able to monetize their browsing data. Users can decide for themselves whether they want to turn data sharing off and browse in private mode or activate the AXplorer data sharing rewards system, which will result in AXC being deposited directly into their integrated AXIA Wallet after hitting certain browsing volumes. Furthermore, users have the potential to earn additional rewards by watching selected videos and ads, visiting suggested websites and responding to short questionnaires. AXplorer has all the same characteristics as the most commonly used browsers and provides the same access to all public websites that users can visit online, but gives them the ability to be in control of their own data. An individual can sync AXplorer across all their devices including phones, computers and tablets.
### AXchat
AXchat is a free messaging app that can also be used for global exchange with people all around the world. AXchat makes communicating and transacting cost efficient, simple and secure in this all in one application. Users can send and receive messages, photos, videos, files and voice notes along with their AXC freely, easily and securely. Individuals can also make voice and video calls to people all around the world at no cost. Users can connect one-on-one or create groups. Users can import contacts from their phone, or find people who are already using AXchat automatically. They can sync AXchat across all their devices whether they be a phone, computer or tablet. This allows users to use multiple devices at the same time. Security is of the highest priority, so AXchat supports end-to-end encryption for messaging, voice notes as well as both voice and video calls.

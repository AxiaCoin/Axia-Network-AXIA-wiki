### AXIA SECURE KEY STORAGE AND TOKEN CUSTODY SERVICE
The self-management and recovery of a user’s public and private wallet keys is a clear challenge slowing the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies. Some of the main concerns of using cryptocurrencies relate to  the ease of use of wallet applications, and overall security of funds. If a user’s keys are lost, forgotten, or in some cases, stolen, their cryptocurrencies and funds are gone forever.

This is why the AXIA Key Storage and Token Custody Service, connected into the “hot” and “cold” wallet application, is invaluable. AXIA has implemented its very own key storage model that incorporates state-of-the-art data encryption to protect a user at all times from potential system attacks that could jeopardize their keys, and stops them from falling into the wrong hands. Additionally, AXIA has implemented an account creation mechanism where a user’s public and private keys are tied to a self-selected email address and their system password can always be re-generated if needed ensuring they will never lose access to their funds. Now, AXIA Coin holders can recover their existing key(s) if lost or forgotten.

Registering within the AXIA public blockchain ecosystem offers a user the ability to securely store their AXIA Coins in both hot and cold storage wallets. A hot wallet account will allow users to immediately send, transfer, exchange and spend their digital AXIA Coins directly out of their wallet, while a “cold” wallet will enable users to securely store their AXIA Coins in an offline storage vault, locking AXIA Coins away until such time as a user wishes to move it into hot status. 

The AXIA custody solution meets and exceeds enterprise-scale custody services that are typically only offered to digital exchanges, investment funds or other institutional-sized clients who pass along the costs for third party management to the individual users. AXIA has specifically integrated its own custody service to allow all AXIA participants – irrespective of wealth or status – to utilize this advanced infrastructure seamlessly for free. The AXIA Foundation will incur any associated custody costs on behalf of the user directly, while the user is in control of their own spendable or vaulted AXIA Coins. 

By utilizing cold storage, a user is designating their own AXIA Coins to be stored and managed offline in a vault. This vault structure is unhackable. All transfers require coordinated actions with multiple factors of authentication to protect users, even if someone were to steal their phone or compromise their desktop application. 

Participants can take advantage of the storage model at the AXIA Capital Bank.

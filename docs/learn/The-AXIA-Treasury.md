The purpose of the AXIA Treasury is to safeguard and reinforce the value of AXIA Coin. The value of AXIA Coin is enhanced by the value stemming from the ability to consistently expand the AXIA Treasury. The assets held in the AXIA Treasury are made transparent to the public in real-time, at all times, visible directly on AXIA Coin website for all to see and transparently verified through the AXIA Real-Time-Reporting Platform. The benefits of the asset-supported model will be shared among the community. 

Based on the AXIA Real-Time-Reporting available on the web dashboard on the AXIA Coin website, AXIA Coin has established a far more secure form of currency and medium of exchange.

The AXIA Treasury will vary in size and volume over time, however the Total Supply of AXIA Coins can only decrease and there will never be minting of more AXIA Coins beyond the Total Supply as the AXIA Foundation has permanently removed that ability from the AXIA Coin contract. The key objective of the AXIA Treasury is to provide balance, stability and preservation of value with a supporting asset base that can expand over time.

AXIA will be providing the AXIA community with a trackable and visible record of all holdings and activity at all times. 

AXIA is nothing like a direct-peg model used by stablecoins or traditional asset-backed structures. AXIA will not attempt to operate as either a synthetic (artificially manipulated) or fiat-like dollar. Instead, AXIA will utilize the ever-expanding AXIA Ecosystem, along with the AXIA Transaction Link, to expand the AXIA Treasury while decreasing Total Supply of AXIA Coins to provide even further value offering a completely transparent unprecedented economic model for a digital currency. 

The ATL therefore acts as the link between AXIA Coin and the AXIA Treasury to create additional value, building off the collaborative activities in the community. Anything that is transparent to the market and meets the stringent standards of the AXIA Real Time Reporting platform that can be easily evaluated and verified by external auditors nodes or the market itself can be used to collateralize the value of AXIA Coin. The benefit of this design is that AXIA Coin is not correlated to any one currency, commodity, market or economy. This results in producing the most secure currency in the market today, while simultaneously acting as a better store and preserver of value than has been established to date â€” a true safe haven.
